  <h1>Married Couples</h1>

  <p1> Many years ago, three married couples waited to cross a river. The boat that they had could only carry two. The boat cannot cross the river by itself with no people on board. However the husbands were terribly jealous and the three wives very loving.
    In fact, no woman could be in the presence of another man unless her husband was also present. Was there any way to cross everyone over the river without there being a scene?

 </p1>
  <p1>   who goes to the side two ? </p1>
